# vvvv-deck

> is a minimal boilerplate to mix vvvv patches

## How to start

Get [vvvv](https://vvvv.org), you will ha*vvvv*e fun!
Go in the deck folder, right click on *root.v4p* and choose **Open as root** in the contextual menu.
You will see a list of patches you can switch by clicking on the buttons, like in the screenshot below.

Please note that there is a preview render on top, while the actual render is elsewhere, you probably want to open it in full screen on another display.
Patches must be saved in the *modules* folder and added manually to the list. All patches must have the same identical outputs.
